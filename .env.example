EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Web / iOS simulator can keep localhost.
# Android emulator should use http://<your computer ip>:8080
# Physical devices should point to http://<your-computer-ip>:8080

# Note: if you want to test from any device (even outside your network),
# start a tunnel with ngrok by running `ngrok http 8080` (or whatever port
# the backend runs on) and update the `EXPO_PUBLIC_URL` with the
# ngrok domain, e.g.:
# `EXPO_PUBLIC_URL=https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app`
